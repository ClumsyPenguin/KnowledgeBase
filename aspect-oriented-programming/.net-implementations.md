# .NET implementations

## Interception (Autofac & DynamicProxy)

* uses runtime proxies to intercept method calls
* dynamically wraps objects -> additional behavior can be applied without modifying the original code directly.

## IL Weaving (MetalLama)

In contrast, IL weaving modifies the Intermediate Language (IL) code during or after compilation.

* injects aspect code directly into the compiled binaries
* less runtime overhead and more static, compile-time integration
