# Overview

### What is AOP

> It is a paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. It does so by adding behavior to existing code _without_ modifying the code. This allows behaviors that are not central to the business logic (such as logging) to be added to a program without cluttering the code of core functions.
