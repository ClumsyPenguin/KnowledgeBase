## Key Concepts

- **Containers**: Lightweight, standalone, executable packages of software that include everything needed to run an application.
- **Container Orchestration**: Automated arrangement, coordination, and management of containers. This includes scheduling, scaling, networking, and more.
- **Declarative vs. Imperative**: Kubernetes encourages a declarative style: you declare the desired state (e.g., "three replicas of my application must be running") and Kubernetes continuously attempts to make the cluster match that state.
